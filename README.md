# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

Welcome to The Anti-Procrastinator!
We are running on Ruby version 5.2.4.
You will need rails s running in one terminal for local host.
To get the frontend running you will need to cd into jsfrontend.
from there you can open the index.html in the browser.
This is a first attempt at making this application with different technologies we will add more functionality.
This base version is for my Flatiron school JS/Rails Project.
You can sign up making an account, log in under that account, view friendly cleaning tips, make simple goals, add and delete those goals.
Thanks! Have a great day! Stop Procrastinating!
